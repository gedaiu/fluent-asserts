description: Assertions for testing value equality
---

Test for value equality with these assertions.

## equal

Asserts that the target is strictly (`==`) equal to the given value.

```d
expect("hello").to.equal("hello");
expect(42).to.equal(42);
```

### With Negation

```d
expect("hello").to.not.equal("world");
```

## approximately

Asserts that a numeric value is within a tolerance of the expected value.

```d
expect(3.14159).to.be.approximately(3.14, 0.01);
```

Useful for floating-point comparisons where exact equality isn't possible.
