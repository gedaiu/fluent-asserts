# .allocateGCMemory()

The `.allocateGCMemory()` assertion checks if a function call allocates memory that is managed by the garbage collector.

This is useful for performance testing to ensure that functions are memory-efficient and do not create unnecessary GC pressure.

## Modifiers

This assertion supports the following modifiers:

- `.not` - Negates the assertion, checking that no GC memory is allocated.
- `.to` - Language chain (no effect).
- `.be` - Language chain (no effect).
