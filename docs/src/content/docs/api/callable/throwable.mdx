description: Asserts that a callable throws a specific exception type
---

Asserts that a callable throws an exception of a specific type during execution.

## throwException

Assert that a specific exception type is thrown:

```d
expect({
    throw new CustomException("error");
}).to.throwException!CustomException;
```

### With Message Checking

Chain `.withMessage` to also verify the exception message:

```d
expect({
    throw new Exception("specific error");
}).to.throwException!Exception.withMessage.equal("specific error");
```

### With Negation

```d
expect({
    // code that doesn't throw
}).to.not.throwException!Exception;
```

## throwAnyException

Assert that any exception is thrown (regardless of type):

```d
expect({
    throw new Exception("error");
}).to.throwAnyException();
```

### With Negation

```d
expect({
    // safe code
    int x = 42;
}).to.not.throwAnyException();
```

## What Failures Look Like

```d
expect({
    // doesn't throw
}).to.throwException!Exception;
```

```
ASSERTION FAILED: delegate should throw Exception.
OPERATION: throwException

  ACTUAL: no exception thrown
EXPECTED: Exception
```
