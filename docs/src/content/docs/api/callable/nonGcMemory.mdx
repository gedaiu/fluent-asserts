title: allocateNonGCMemory
description: Asserts that a callable allocates non-GC memory (malloc, etc.)
---

Asserts that a callable allocates memory outside of the garbage collector during its execution. This includes manual memory allocation via `malloc`, `core.stdc.stdlib`, or similar mechanisms.

## Examples

```d
import core.stdc.stdlib : malloc, free;

expect({
    auto ptr = malloc(1024);
    free(ptr);
}).to.allocateNonGCMemory();
```

### With Negation

```d
expect({
    int x = 42;  // no allocation
    return x;
}).to.not.allocateNonGCMemory();
```

### What Failures Look Like

```d
expect({
    int x = 42;
    return x;
}).to.allocateNonGCMemory();
```

```
ASSERTION FAILED: delegate should allocate non-GC memory.
OPERATION: allocateNonGCMemory

  ACTUAL: no non-GC allocations
EXPECTED: non-GC allocations
```
