# .allocateNonGCMemory()

The `.allocateNonGCMemory()` assertion checks if a function call allocates memory that is **not** managed by the garbage collector.

This is useful for tracking manual memory allocations.

## Modifiers

This assertion supports the following modifiers:

- `.not` - Negates the assertion, checking that no non-GC memory is allocated.
- `.to` - Language chain (no effect).
- `.be` - Language chain (no effect).
