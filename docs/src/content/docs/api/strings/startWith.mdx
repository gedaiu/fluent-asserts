Asserts that a string starts with the expected prefix.

## Examples

```d
expect("hello").to.startWith("hel");
expect("https://example.com").to.startWith("https://");
```

### With Negation

```d
expect("hello").to.not.startWith("world");
```

### What Failures Look Like

```d
expect("hello").to.startWith("xyz");
```

```
ASSERTION FAILED: hello should start with xyz. hello does not start with xyz.
OPERATION: startWith

  ACTUAL: <string> hello
EXPECTED: <string> to start with xyz
```
