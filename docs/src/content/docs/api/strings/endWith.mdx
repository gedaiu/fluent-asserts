---

Asserts that a string ends with the expected suffix.

## Examples

```d
expect("hello").to.endWith("llo");
expect("file.txt").to.endWith(".txt");
expect("str\ning").to.endWith("ing");
```

### With Negation

```d
expect("hello").to.not.endWith("xyz");
```

### What Failures Look Like

```d
expect("hello").to.endWith("xyz");
```

```
ASSERTION FAILED: hello should end with xyz. hello does not end with xyz.
OPERATION: endWith

  ACTUAL: <string> hello
EXPECTED: <string> to end with xyz
```
