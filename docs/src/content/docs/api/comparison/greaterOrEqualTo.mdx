description: Asserts that a value is greater than or equal to the expected value
---

Asserts that a value is greater than or equal to the expected value.

## Examples

```d
expect(10).to.be.greaterOrEqualTo(5);
expect(5).to.be.greaterOrEqualTo(5);  // equal values pass
```

### With Negation

```d
expect(3).to.not.be.greaterOrEqualTo(5);
```

### What Failures Look Like

```d
expect(3).to.be.greaterOrEqualTo(5);
```

```
ASSERTION FAILED: 3 should be greater or equal to 5. 3 is less than 5.
OPERATION: greaterOrEqualTo

  ACTUAL: <int> 3
EXPECTED: <int> greater or equal than 5
```
