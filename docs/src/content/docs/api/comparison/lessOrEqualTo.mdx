description: Asserts that a value is less than or equal to the expected value
---

Asserts that a value is less than or equal to the expected value.

## Examples

```d
expect(5).to.be.lessOrEqualTo(10);
expect(5).to.be.lessOrEqualTo(5);  // equal values pass
```

### With Negation

```d
expect(10).to.not.be.lessOrEqualTo(5);
```

### What Failures Look Like

```d
expect(5).to.be.lessOrEqualTo(3);
```

```
ASSERTION FAILED: 5 should be less or equal to 3. 5 is greater than 3.
OPERATION: lessOrEqualTo

  ACTUAL: <int> 5
EXPECTED: <int> less or equal to 3
```
