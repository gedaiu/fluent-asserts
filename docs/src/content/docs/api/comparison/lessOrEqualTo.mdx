# .lessOrEqualToDuration()

Asserts that the tested value is less or equal than the tested value. However, it's often best to assert that the target is equal to its expected value.

Asserts that a value is less than or equal to the expected value.

## Examples

### Basic Usage

```d
expect(smallValue).to.be.lessOrEqualTo(largeValue);
expect(smallValue).to.be.lessOrEqualTo(smallValue);
expect(smallValue).to.be.lessOrEqualTo(largeValue);
expect(smallValue).to.be.lessOrEqualTo(smallValue);
```

### With Negation

```d
expect(largeValue).not.to.be.lessOrEqualTo(smallValue);
expect(largeValue).not.to.be.lessOrEqualTo(smallValue);
```

### What Failures Look Like

When the assertion fails, you'll see a clear error message:

```d
// This would fail:
expect(largeValue).to.be.lessOrEqualTo(smallValue);
```

## Modifiers

This assertion supports the following modifiers:

- `.not` - Negates the assertion
- `.to` - Language chain (no effect)
- `.be` - Language chain (no effect)
