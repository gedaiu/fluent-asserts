description: Asserts that a value is strictly greater than the expected value
---

Asserts that a value is strictly greater than the expected value.

## Examples

```d
expect(10).to.be.greaterThan(5);
expect(42).to.be.above(10);  // alias
```

### With Negation

```d
expect(5).to.not.be.greaterThan(10);
```

### What Failures Look Like

```d
expect(3).to.be.greaterThan(5);
```

```
ASSERTION FAILED: 3 should be greater than 5. 3 is less than or equal to 5.
OPERATION: greaterThan

  ACTUAL: <int> 3
EXPECTED: <int> greater than 5
```

## Aliases

- `.above()` - Same behavior as `.greaterThan()`
