description: Asserts that a value is strictly between two bounds (exclusive)
---

Asserts that a value is strictly between two bounds (exclusive). The value must be greater than the lower bound and less than the upper bound.

## Examples

```d
expect(5).to.be.between(1, 10);
expect(50).to.be.between(0, 100);
```

### With Negation

```d
expect(10).to.not.be.between(1, 5);
expect(0).to.not.be.between(1, 10);
```

### What Failures Look Like

```d
expect(10).to.be.between(1, 5);
```

```
ASSERTION FAILED: 10 should be between 1 and 5. 10 is greater than or equal to 5.
OPERATION: between

  ACTUAL: <int> 10
EXPECTED: <int> a value inside (1, 5) interval
```
