description: Asserts that a value is strictly less than the expected value
---

Asserts that a value is strictly less than the expected value.

## Examples

```d
expect(5).to.be.lessThan(10);
expect(10).to.be.below(42);  // alias
```

### With Negation

```d
expect(10).to.not.be.lessThan(5);
```

### What Failures Look Like

```d
expect(5).to.be.lessThan(3);
```

```
ASSERTION FAILED: 5 should be less than 3. 5 is greater than or equal to 3.
OPERATION: lessThan

  ACTUAL: <int> 5
EXPECTED: <int> less than 3
```

## Aliases

- `.below()` - Same behavior as `.lessThan()`
