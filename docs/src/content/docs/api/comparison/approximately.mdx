title: .approximately()
description: Asserts that a numeric value is within a tolerance range of the expected value
---

Asserts that a numeric value is within a given delta (tolerance) range of the expected value. Useful for floating-point comparisons where exact equality is unreliable.

## Examples

```d
expect(0.1 + 0.2).to.be.approximately(0.3, 0.0001);
expect(3.14159).to.be.approximately(3.14, 0.01);
```

### With Arrays

```d
expect([0.1, 0.2, 0.3]).to.be.approximately([0.1, 0.2, 0.3], 0.001);
```

### With Negation

```d
expect(1.0).to.not.be.approximately(2.0, 0.1);
```

### What Failures Look Like

```d
expect(0.5).to.be.approximately(0.3, 0.1);
```

```
ASSERTION FAILED: 0.5 should be approximately 0.3±0.1. 0.5 is not approximately 0.3±0.1.
OPERATION: approximately

  ACTUAL: <double> 0.5
EXPECTED: <double> 0.3±0.1
```
