This page shows what assertion failure messages look like for each operation. Use this as a reference to understand the output format when tests fail.

## equal

### Positive failure

```d
expect(5).to.equal(3);
```

```
ASSERTION FAILED: 5 should equal 3.
OPERATION: equal

  ACTUAL: <int> 5
EXPECTED: <int> 3
```

### Negated failure

```d
expect(5).to.not.equal(5);
```

```
ASSERTION FAILED: 5 should not equal 5.
OPERATION: not equal

  ACTUAL: <int> 5
EXPECTED: <int> not 5
```

## contain

### String - Positive failure

```d
expect("hello").to.contain("xyz");
```

```
ASSERTION FAILED: hello should contain xyz. xyz is missing from hello.
OPERATION: contain

  ACTUAL: <string> hello
EXPECTED: <string> to contain xyz
```

### Array - Positive failure

```d
expect([1,2,3]).to.contain(5);
```

```
ASSERTION FAILED: [1, 2, 3] should contain 5. 5 is missing from [1, 2, 3].
OPERATION: contain

  ACTUAL: <int[]> [1, 2, 3]
EXPECTED: <int> to contain 5
```

## containOnly

### Positive failure

```d
expect([1,2,3]).to.containOnly([1,2]);
```

```
ASSERTION FAILED: [1, 2, 3] should contain only [1, 2].
OPERATION: containOnly

  ACTUAL: <int[]> [1, 2, 3]
EXPECTED: <int[]> to contain only [1, 2]
```

## greaterThan

### Positive failure

```d
expect(3).to.be.greaterThan(5);
```

```
ASSERTION FAILED: 3 should be greater than 5. 3 is less than or equal to 5.
OPERATION: greaterThan

  ACTUAL: <int> 3
EXPECTED: <int> greater than 5
```

## lessThan

### Positive failure

```d
expect(5).to.be.lessThan(3);
```

```
ASSERTION FAILED: 5 should be less than 3. 5 is greater than or equal to 3.
OPERATION: lessThan

  ACTUAL: <int> 5
EXPECTED: <int> less than 3
```

## between

### Positive failure

```d
expect(10).to.be.between(1, 5);
```

```
ASSERTION FAILED: 10 should be between 1 and 5. 10 is greater than or equal to 5.
OPERATION: between

  ACTUAL: <int> 10
EXPECTED: <int> a value inside (1, 5) interval
```

## approximately

### Positive failure

```d
expect(0.5).to.be.approximately(0.3, 0.1);
```

```
ASSERTION FAILED: 0.5 should be approximately 0.3±0.1. 0.5 is not approximately 0.3±0.1.
OPERATION: approximately

  ACTUAL: <double> 0.5
EXPECTED: <double> 0.3±0.1
```

## beNull

### Positive failure

```d
Object obj = new Object();
expect(obj).to.beNull;
```

```
ASSERTION FAILED: Object should be null.
OPERATION: beNull

  ACTUAL: <object.Object> object.Object
EXPECTED: <unknown> null
```

## instanceOf

### Positive failure

```d
expect(new Object()).to.be.instanceOf!Exception;
```

```
ASSERTION FAILED: Object should be instance of "object.Exception".
OPERATION: instanceOf

  ACTUAL: <object.Object> typeof object.Object
EXPECTED: <object.Exception> typeof object.Exception
```
